WordPress Benchmark tests the speed of your WordPress server's CPU, network and database and shows you how you compare against everyone else. 

== Description ==

WordPress Benchmark runs a benchmark test on your WordPress server's CPU, database and network speed to give you a measure of how fast your WordPress server is.
Benchmark will then send your data anonymously to a central database and will in return get back the average CPU, database and network benchmarks to show
you how your WordPress server compares against the industry average.

Benchmark is a great way to compare hosting providers and the quality of their servers. You can use the scores provided to compare CPU speed, network speed and database speed.
